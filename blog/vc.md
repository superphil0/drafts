# Intro
Last week I had a great lecturer at my university startup course. Ivan Nikkhoo.
He has an extraordinary personality, smart, charming and always right.
If you don't know him don't worry, just take away this. He is one of those guys,
who really knows how the game of investment banking is played.
Think of what Albert Einstein said "You have to learn the rules of the game. And then you have to play better than anyone else". He manages a Venture Capital (VC) fund and has a great track record.
I will try to summarize some lessons learned about VC and companies in general.
My assumptions are based for company law in the US, but can be applied to great extend all over the world.

* Forms of equity ownership
* Venture Capital Funds and how they work

# The Fundamentals
* A company is owned by it's share holders
* A company's primarily goal is to make profit for it's share holders

### What forms of equity ownership are there?
Often many parties own one company, this reduces risk for the individual investor. Company ownership is distributed by issuing "shares" which all represent an equal part of the company.
To protect investors different forms of ownership exist. Each form has different rights associated with them. If things are not too clear why this all needed, I will provide an example where things should come together.

#### Common stock
Common stock is the most basic unit of ownership. Owners have voting rights, common stock has the lowest preference in a liquidation event (when the company is sold or goes bankrupt).
##### Example
Two people found a company, they agree to take half of the company each, this can be turned into common stock.

#### Preferred stock
Preferred stock has all rights common stock has. In a case of liquidation money from the sales of assets is first distributed to preferred stock holders, then to common stock holders, thus preferred. It can also be agreed upon that preferred stock has to be paid back at a multiple of the proceeds. Furthermore there is the class of participating preferred shares, this means that when a company is liquidated, the first the preferred shares are paid back, and then the money is split under all other investors, including the preferred stock owner (thus he participates).
##### Example
Let's consider the last example, the founders own the company to 100%. They need money and decide to raise capital from two investors, 1 million dollars each at each 12.5 %, this sets the pre investment valuation to 6 million, post valuation that is 8 million, 6 + 1. One investor Alice gets preferred shares, investor Bob gets preferred shares with 2x participation.
Let's consider for a moment our company shuts down and 4 million dollars are left in the company. Bob would get 2 million dollars back first. Alice would get back 1 million dollars. After that the founders would split the remaining 1 million with the Bob, because he is participating with his 12.5 %. So the founder would get each 437 thousand dollars. I will let you figure out this one on your own.
##### Stock options
A stock option admits the owner the right to buy common stock at an agreed upon price. One option for one share. Usually, they are used for startups as an incentive and safeguard. Founders will get options every six months, this will protect investors of founders that just leave on bad term but still will get shares.

##### Convertible notes
A convertible note is an instrument that is often used in early stages of startup funding. It is used when investor and the companies principals can not or don't want to set a valuation for the investment but defer it to the next valuation event (i.e. capital injection). It has three parameters, a maximum runtime (i.e. 24 months), a discount rate (i.e. 20 % a year) and a cap (i.e. investor will get at least 10 % of shares), which are to limit the flexibility.
######Example
Like in the first example two founders own the company they raise 1 million dollar, but can not decide with the investor how many preferred shares he should get. They agree on a convertible note with 20% discount and a 15 % cap and 24 months after which the note is converted automatically to 25% share stake. Everybody is happy, they raise the next round, 5 million at a valuation of 20 million pre investment, after 12 months. The last investor would now get shares equivalent to 1.2 million of the 20 million pre money evaluation which is 6 %.

##### Dilution
Dilution is not a form of ownership, it is exactly the opposite so to say. It means that if I have shares in a company, and a new investor comes in, he will get new shares, making me own less of the total amount of shares.

###### Example
A company has a 100 shares. Investor A holds 20 of those shares. Investor B comes in and for his investment another 20 shares are issued (Investor A does not have to give away any of his). Before I held 20 / 100 = 20% of the shares, after Investor B gets his shares I only own 20/120 = 16.6% of the company with the same amount of shares.

### Venture capital Funds
Of course it doesn't make sense to invest only in one startup with a high risk of failure. That is the reason why there are venture capital funds. Usually a venture capital firm raises money from multiple institutional investors for a fund and the invests in multiple startups with this money. The most common model is the 220. The management company takes 2% management fee per year, and 20 percent of the profit at the end of the fund which typically lasts 10 years. They are expected to perform at a rate of 4 to 5 times net of the invested money. Ok, so lets pause for a moment, what does this timeframe mean for the venture firm? Within 10 years, they have to go through the process of getting stakes in valuable companies, hold them for some years and sell off their shares before the 10 years are over, so they can return the money to the investors.
These funds can have different sizes, ranging from 20 million to the lower billions. Typically a fund is invested in around 20 companies with different but similar investments.

#### Example
We opened a 220 venture capital fund and raised 100 million with a 10 year runtime, a return of 5 times is expected. How much money do we have to generate in order to satisfy our investors?
2 % are 2 million per year for ten years are 20 million. To that come the 20 % "carry" at the end of the prospected 500 million at the funds end. That are a hundred million, but we have to return 5 times net to our investors, so we need to earn more money. In total we have to earn 620 million. Half of all startups usually fail of the portfolio in a fund, so a company now has to make 12x to to be profitable for the fund. Or at least it must have the potential. So if I as a manager invest 5 million dollars in exchange for 30 % shares (I am making number up now), then it has to be able to return me 60 million after maximum 10 years, better sooner. If a company grows that fast, it needs money, a lot. That means another investor will come on board and thus dilute my shares, so I will end up with around 10-15 % of the company. Let's assume 10% for the sake of the argument. Ok, so here we are I invested 5 million and I expect 60 million return, if I own 10% at the time of sale, the valuation of the company should be around 600 million. Welcome to the real world.

In the next post I will try to put about the possibilities to put a price tag on a company and the different valuation forms investment bankers use.
