# Intro
Last week I had a great lecturer at my university startup course. Ivan Nikkhoo.
He has an extrodinary personality, smart, charming and always right.
If you don't know him don't worry, just take away this. He is one of those guys,
who really knows how the game of investment banking is played.
Think of what Albert Einstein said "You have to learn the rules of the game. And then you have to play better than anyone else". He manages a Venture Capital (VC) fund and has a great track record.
I will try to summarize some lessons learned about VC and companies in general.
My assumptions are based for company law in the US, but can be applied to great extend all over the world.

* Forms of equity ownership
* Venture Capital Funds and how they work
* Company valuation

# The Fundamentals
* A company is owned by it's share holders
* A company's primarily goal is to make profit for it's the share holders

### What forms of equity ownership are there?
Often many parties own one company, this reduces risk for the individual investor. Company ownership is distributed by issuing "shares" which all represent an equal part of the company.
To protect investors different forms of ownership exist. Each form has different rights associated with them. If things are not too clear why this all needed, I will provide an example where things should come together.

#### Common stock
Common stock is the most basic unit of ownership. Owners have voting rights, common stock has the lowest preference in a liquidation event (when the company is sold or goes bankrupt).
#### Preferred stock
Preferred stock has all rights common stock has. In a case of liquidation money from the sales of assets is first distributed to preferred stock holders, then to common stock holders, thus preferred. It can also be agreed upon that preferred stock has to be paid back at a multiple of the proceeds. Furthermore there is the class of participating preferred shares, this means that when a company is liquidated, the first the preferred shares are paid back, and then the money is split under all other investors, including the preferred stock owner (thus he participates).
##### Stock options
A stock option admits the owner the right to buy common stock at an agreed upon price. One option for one share

##### Convertible notes
